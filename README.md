# MailBot
MailBot is a simple Discord bot that displays package tracking information using the Discord.js library and the AfterShip API.

##Getting Started
To use this bot, you must first get a Discord Bot token [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications). You must also sign up to AfterShip and get an API key [here](https://admin.aftership.com/settings/api-keys).

Once you've gotten your api keys, fork the repository and create a `config.json` file in the root directory with a `discordKey` and a `aftershipKey` attribute. Make sure you've installed Node.js with both the AfterShip and the discord.js libraries installed before you start the bot.
